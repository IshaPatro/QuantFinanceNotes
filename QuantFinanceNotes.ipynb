    "## Zero-Coupon Bond\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay periodic interest (coupons). Instead, it is sold at a deep discount to its face value, and the bondholder receives the full face value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the face value represents the investor's profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Zero-Coupon Bonds Work**:\n",
    "1. **Issuance**: Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a discount to their face value. For example, a bond with a face value of \\\\$1,000 might be sold for \\$750.\n",
    "2. **No Periodic Payments**: Unlike traditional bonds, zero-coupon bonds do not make periodic interest payments.\n",
    "3. **Maturity**: At maturity, the bondholder receives the bond’s face value. The return on investment is the difference between the purchase price and the face value.\n",
    "4. **Investor Profit**: The profit earned from holding a zero-coupon bond comes from the appreciation of the bond’s value over time as it approaches maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **P** = Price of the bond (current price or the price at which it is sold)\n",
    "- **F** = Face value of the bond (amount received at maturity)\n",
    "- **r** = Annual interest rate (or yield)\n",
    "- **n** = Number of years until maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: There are no periodic interest payments to track.\n",
    "- **Long-Term Growth**: Ideal for long-term investment strategies, especially when held to maturity.\n",
    "- **Predictability**: The exact amount to be received at maturity is known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks**:\n",
    "- **Interest Rate Risk**: If interest rates rise, the present value of the bond decreases.\n",
    "- **Inflation Risk**: The fixed face value does not adjust for inflation, which can erode purchasing power over time."

    "- **Maturity**: At the bond’s maturity date, the bondholder receives the bond’s face value along with the final coupon payment.\n",
    "- **Investor Profit**: Profit comes from both the periodic coupon payments and the repayment of the face value at maturity.\n",

    "- **Diverse Investment**: Bonds help diversify portfolios and balance risk, especially in volatile equity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks**:\n",
    "- **Interest Rate Risk**: When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, as newer bonds may offer higher coupons.\n",
    "- **Credit Risk**: The bond issuer may default on interest payments or repayment of the face value.\n",
